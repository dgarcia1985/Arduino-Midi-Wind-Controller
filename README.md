# Arduino Midi Wind Controller 
<a href="README.en.md">English</a>   
This is the code and Assets for a cheap DIY Midi Wind Controller.  
My goal was to make a cheap controller with better dynamics than a midi keyboard to play trumpets, sax, etc ...  
It's built with 3D printed parts, spare parts from broken videogame controllers and sensors. 

It uses and Arduino Uno and have the following functionalities.  

* 12 buttons to select which notes are playing.  
* 1 pressure sensor to detect blowing.
* 1 Joystick used as pitch / modulation wheel.
* 1 linear pot to control attack with bite pressure.
* 8 buttons for configuration / calibration of the device.
