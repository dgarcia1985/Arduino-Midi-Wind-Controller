# Arduino Midi Wind Controller 
<a href="README.md">Espa√±ol</a>   
This is the code and Assets for a DIY Midi Wind Controller.  
My goal was to make a cheap controller with better dynamics than a midi keyboard to play trumpets, sax, etc ...  
It's built with 3D printed parts, spare parts from broken videogame controllers and usb devices and a sensor. 

It uses and Arduino Uno and have the following functionalities.  

* 12 buttons to select which notes are playing.  
* 1 GY-68 BMP180 pressure sensor to detect blowing.
* 1 Joystick from an old GameCube Controller used as pitch / modulation wheel.
* 1 linear pot from an old GameCube Controller to control attack with bite pressure.
* 8 buttons for configuration / calibration of the device.

The picture below shows the wiring diagram of the device:
